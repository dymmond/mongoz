# Documents

As you are probably aware, MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't have tables but
**documents** instead.

This also means that with documents and NoSQL, **there are no joins and foreign keys**.

**Mongoz** implements those documents in a more friendly interface if you are still familiar with
ORMs or even if you use somethig like [Edgy][edgy]. No reason to overcomplicate, right?
