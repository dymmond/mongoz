# Release Notes

## 0.1.0

This is the initial release of Edgy.

### Key features

* **Document inheritance** - For those cases where you don't want to repeat yourself while maintaining integrity of the documents.
* **Abstract classes** - That's right! Sometimes you simply want a document that holds common fields that doesn't need to created as
a document in the database.
* **Meta classes** - If you are familiar with Django, this is not new to you and Mongoz offers this in the same fashion.
* **Filters** - Filter by any field you want and need.
* **Model operators** - Classic operations such as `update`, `get`, `get_or_none` and many others.
* **Indexes** - Unique indexes through meta fields.
* **Signals** - Quite useful feature if you want to "listen" to what is happening with your documents.

And a lot more you can do here.
